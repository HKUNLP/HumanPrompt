Generate SQL given the question, table, passages, image captions to answer the question correctly.
If question-relevant column(s) contents are not suitable for SQL comparisons or calculations, map it to a new column with clean content by a new grammar QA("map@").
If mapping to a new column still can not answer the question with valid SQL, turn to an end-to-end solution by a new grammar QA("ans@"). This grammar aims to solve all the rest of complex questions or tables or passages or image captions.
