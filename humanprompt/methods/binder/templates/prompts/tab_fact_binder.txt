Generate SQL given the statement and table to verify the statement correctly.
If statement-relevant column(s) contents are not suitable for SQL comparisons or calculations, map it to a new column with clean content by a new grammar QA("map@").
If mapping to a new column still can not answer the statement with valid SQL, turn to an end-to-end solution by a new grammar QA("ans@"). This grammar aims to solve all the rest of complex statements or tables.
