# Hub-like weight storage

Each file is a weight file like https://huggingface.co/hkunlp/T5_large_prefix_all_tasks_2upsample2

We load the config and prompt from each file as we get the finetuned model.
And people can freely change that and add the model to the hub.

This hub-like file will be uploaded to a seperated repo as a place for sharing.
